✨ Key Features:

File & Folder Encryption: Secure files or entire directories with a password.
Custom Salt Size: Strengthen encryption by customizing salt size.
Multiple Hashing Options: Generate MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and other hashes for integrity checks.
CLI Friendly: Intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.

🔧 How It Works: 
 Encryption: Uses a password-derived key and unique salt for each session.
 Decryption: Only decryptable with the correct password and salt.
 Hash Generation: Creates file fingerprints to verify integrity.<br><br>
🛠️ Usage:<br>
🔒 Encrypt/Decrypt: 
 Secure files with -e to encrypt, -d to decrypt.<br>
🔒Hashing: 
 Use -ha to choose a hashing algorithm for integrity checks.<br>
🔐 Security: 
TORPEDO leverages Scrypt KDF for brute-force resistance and Fernet encryption for secure data handling.

✨ Practical Applications:

Data Protection: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
File Integrity: Ensure data authenticity post-encryption or during transfers.
